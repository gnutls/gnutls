# The test verifies that gnutls_protocol_mark_{disabled,enabled}
# behave sensibly. The test requires allowlisting and is to be executed
# from within the shell wrapper protocol-mark-allowlisting.sh
# The shell part of it feeds commands into a C helper
# and compares its output to the reference output.
