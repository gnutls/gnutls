Abstract

   This specification specifies a TLS handshake message for exchange of
   supplemental application data.  TLS hello message extensions are used
   to determine which supplemental data types are supported by both the
   TLS client and the TLS server.  Then, the supplemental data handshake
   message is used to exchange the data.  Other documents will define
   the syntax of these extensions and the syntax of the associated
   supplemental data types.

INTERNET DRAFT TLS Handshake Message for Supplemental Data    April 2006


1.  Introduction

   Recent standards activities have proposed different mechanisms for
   transmitting supplemental application data in the TLS handshake
   message.  For example, recent proposals transfer data that is not
   processed by the TLS protocol itself, but assist the TLS-protected
   application in the authentication and authorization decisions.  One
   proposal transfers user name hints for locating credentials, and
   another proposal transfers attribute certificates and SAML assertions
   for authorization checks.

   In order to avoid definition of multiple handshake messages, one for
   each new type of application specific supplemental data, this
   specification defines a new handshake message type that bundles all
   such data objects together and sends them in a single handshake
   message.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [STDWORDS].

   The syntax for the supplemental_data handshake message is defined
   using the TLS Presentation Language, which is specified in Section 4
   of [N2].

2  Supplemental Data Handshake Message

   The new supplemental_data handshake message type is defined to
   accommodate communication of supplemental data objects as agreed
   during the exchange of extensions in the client and server hello
   messages.  See RFC 2246 (TLS 1.0) [N2] and RFC 4346 (TLS 1.1) [N3]
   for other handshake message types.


      enum {
             supplemental_data(TBD), (255)
         } HandshakeType;

      struct {
             HandshakeType msg_type;    /* handshake type */
             uint24 length;             /* octets in message */
             select (HandshakeType) {
                    case supplemental_data:   SupplementalData;
               } body;
          } Handshake;

      struct {
            SupplementalDataEntry supp_data<1..2^24-1>;
         } SupplementalData;

      struct {
            SupplementalDataType supp_data_type;
            select(SupplementalDataType) { }
         } SupplementalDataEntry;

      enum {
            (65535)
        } SupplementalDataType;


   If present, the SupplementalData handshake message MUST contain a
   non-empty SupplementalDataEntry structure carrying data associated
   with at least one defined SupplementalDataType.  An explicit
   agreement that governs presence of any supplemental data MUST be
   concluded between client and server for each SupplementalDataType
   using the TLS extensions in the client and server hello messages.

   Other documents will specify specific SupplementalDataType and their
   associated data syntax and processing.  These same specifications
   must also specify the client and server hello message extensions that
   are used to negotiate the support for the specified supplemental data
   type.  This document simply specifies the TLS Handshake Protocol
   message that will carry the supplemental data objects.

   Different situations require the transfer of supplemental data from
   the client to the server, require the transfer of supplemental data
   from server to the client, or require the transfer of supplemental
   data from the client to the server as well as the transfer from the
   server to the client.  All three situations are fully supported.

4  Message flow

   The SupplementalData handshake message, if exchanged, MUST be sent as
   the first handshake message as illustrated in Figure 1 below.

5  Security Considerations

   Each SupplementalDataType included in the handshake message defined
   in this specification introduces its own unique set of security
   properties and related considerations.  Security considerations must
   therefore be defined in each document that defines a supplemetal data
   type.

7 IANA Considerations

   IANA needs to take the following actions:

   1) Create an entry, supplemental_data(TBD), in the existing registry
   for HandshakeType (defined in RFC 2246 [N2]).

   2) Establish a registry for TLS Supplemental Data Formats
   (SupplementalDataType). Values in the inclusive range 0-16385
   (decimal) are assigned via RFC 2434 [N5] Standards Action.  Values
   from the inclusive range 16386-65279 (decimal) are assigned via RFC
   2434 Specification Required.  Values from the inclusive range
   65280-65535 (decimal) are reserved for RFC 2434 Private Use.
