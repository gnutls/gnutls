Abstract

   RFC 4492 describes elliptic curve cipher suites for Transport Layer
   Security (TLS).  However, all those cipher suites use SHA-1 as their
   MAC algorithm.  This document describes eight new CipherSuites for
   TLS/DTLS which specify stronger digest algorithms.  Four use HMAC
   with SHA-256 or SHA-384 and four use AES in Galois Counter Mode
   (GCM).

Internet-Draft               TLS ECC New MAC               February 2008


1.  Introduction

   RFC 4492 [RFC4492] describes Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) cipher
   suites for Transport Layer Security (TLS).  However, all of the RFC
   4492 suites use HMAC-SHA1 as their MAC algorithm.  Due to recent
   analytic work on SHA-1 [Wang05], the IETF is gradually moving away
   from SHA-1 and towards stronger hash algorithms.  This document
   specifies TLS ECC cipher suites which replace SHA-256 and SHA-384
   rather than SHA-1.

   TLS 1.2 [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis], adds support for authenticated
   encryption with additional data (AEAD) cipher modes
   [I-D.mcgrew-auth-enc].  This document also specifies a set of ECC
   cipher suites using one such mode, Galois Counter Mode (GCM) [GCM].
   Another document [I-D.salowey-tls-rsa-aes-gcm], provides support for
   GCM with other key establishment methods.

1.1.  Conventions Used In This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Cipher Suites

   This document defines 8 new cipher suites to be added to TLS.  All
   use Elliptic Curve Cryptography for key exchange and digital
   signature, as defined in RFC 4492.

2.1.  HMAC-based Cipher Suites

   The first four cipher suites use AES [AES] in CBC [CBC] mode with an
   HMAC-based MAC:

       CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256  = {0xXX,XX};
       CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384  = {0xXX,XX};
       CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256   = {0xXX,XX};
       CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384   = {0xXX,XX};

   These four cipher suites are the same as the corresponding cipher
   suites in RFC 4492 (TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA,
   TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, and
   TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA) except for the hash and PRF
   algorithms, which are SHA-256 and SHA-384 [SHS] as follows.

      Cipher Suite                                MAC          PRF
      ------------                                ---          ---
      TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256     HMAC-SHA-256 P_SHA-256
      TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384     HMAC-SHA-384 P_SHA-384
      TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256      HMAC-SHA-256 P_SHA-256
      TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384      HMAC-SHA-384 P_SHA-384

2.2.  Galois Counter Mode-based Cipher Suites

   The second four cipher suites use the new authenticated encryption
   modes defined in TLS 1.2 with AES in Galois Counter Mode (GCM) [GCM]:

       CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256  = {0xXX,XX};
       CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384  = {0xXX,XX};
       CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256   = {0xXX,XX};
       CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384   = {0xXX,XX};

   These cipher suites use authenticated encryption with additional data
   algorithms AEAD_AES_128_GCM and AEAD_AES_256_GCM described in
   [I-D.mcgrew-auth-enc].  The "nonce" input to the AEAD algorithm SHALL
   be 12 bytes long, and is "partially implicit" (see Section 3.2.1 of
   [I-D.mcgrew-auth-enc]).  Part of the nonce is generated as part of
   the handshake process and is static for the entire session and part
   is carried in each packet.

             struct {
                opaque salt[4];
                opaque explicit_nonce_part[8];
             } GCMNonce.

   The salt value is either the client_write_IV if the client is sending
   or the server_write_IV if the server is sending.  These IVs SHALL be
   4 bytes long.  Therefore, for all the algorithms defined in this
   section, SecurityParameters.fixed_iv_length=4.

   The explicit_nonce_part is chosen by the sender and included in the
   packet.  Each value of the explicit_nonce_part MUST be distinct from
   all other values, for any fixed key.  Failure to meet this uniqueness
   requirement can significantly degrade security.  The
   explicit_nonce_part is carried in the IV field of the
   GenericAEADCipher structure.  Therefore, for all the algorithms
   defined in this section, SecurityParameters.record_iv_length=8.

   In the case of TLS the counter MAY be the 64-bit sequence number.  In
   the case of Datagram TLS [RFC4347] the counter MAY be formed from the
   concatenation of the 16-bit epoch with the 48-bit sequence number.

   The PRF algorithms SHALL be as follows:

Internet-Draft               TLS ECC New MAC               February 2008


   For TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and
   TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 it SHALL be P_SHA-256.

   For TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA384 and
   TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA384 it SHALL be P_SHA-384.


3.  TLS Versions

   Because these cipher suites depend on features available only in TLS
   1.2 (PRF flexibility and combined authenticated encryption cipher
   modes), they MUST NOT be negotiated by older versions of TLS.
   Clients MUST NOT offer these cipher suites if they do not offer TLS
   1.2 or later.  Servers which select an earlier version of TLS MUST
   NOT select one of these cipher suites.  Because TLS has no way for
   the client to indicate that it supports TLS 1.2 but not earlier, a
   non-compliant server might potentially negotiate TLS 1.1 or earlier
   and select one of the cipher suites in this document.  Clients MUST
   check the TLS version and generate a fatal "illegal_parameter" alert
   if they detect an incorrect version.


4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in RFC 4346 and RFC 4492 apply to this
   document as well.  The remainder of this section describes security
   considerations specific to the cipher suites described in this
   document.

4.1.  Downgrade Attack

   TLS negotiation is only as secure as the weakest cipher suite that is
   supported.  For instance, an implementation which supports both 160-
   bit and 256-bit elliptic curves can be subject to an active downgrade
   attack to the 160-bit security level.  An attacker who can attack
   that can then forge the Finished handshake check and successfully
   mount a man-in-the-middle attack.

4.2.  Perfect Forward Secrecy

   The static ECDH cipher suites specified in this document do not
   provide perfect forward secrecy (PFS).  Thus, compromise of a single
   static key leads to potential decryption of all traffic protected
   using that key.  Implementors of this specification SHOULD provide at
   least one ECDHE mode of operation.

4.3.  Counter Reuse with GCM

   AES-GCM is only secure if the counter is never reused.  The IV
   construction algorithm above is designed to ensure that this cannot
   happen.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned the following values for these cipher suites:

      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256   = {0xXX,XX};
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384   = {0xXX,XX};
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256    = {0xXX,XX};
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384    = {0xXX,XX};
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256   = {0xXX,XX};
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384   = {0xXX,XX};
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256    = {0xXX,XX};
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384    = {0xXX,XX};
