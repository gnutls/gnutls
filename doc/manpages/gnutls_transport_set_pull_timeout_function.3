.SH " DESCRIPTION"
This is the function where you set a function for gnutls to know
whether data are ready to be received. It should wait for data a
given time frame in milliseconds. The callback should return 0 on 
timeout, a positive number if data can be received, and \-1 on error.
You'll need to override this function if \fBselect()\fP is not suitable
for the provided transport calls. 
The callback function is used in DTLS only.
 \fIgnutls_pull_timeout_func\fP is of the form,
ssize_t (*gnutls_pull_timeout_func)(gnutls_transport_ptr_t, unsigned int ms);
