.SH ARGUMENTS

.SH " DESCRIPTION"
This function sets a certificate/private key pair in the
gnutls_certificate_credentials_t structure.  This function may be
called more than once, in case multiple keys/certificates exist for
the server.  For clients that need to send more than its own end
entity certificate, e.g., also an intermediate CA cert, then the \fIcertfile\fP must contain the ordered certificate chain.

This function can also accept PKCS \fB11\fP URLs at \fIkeyfile\fP and \fIcertfile\fP. In that case it
will import the private key and certificate indicated by the URLs.
.SH " RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) on success, or a negative error code.
