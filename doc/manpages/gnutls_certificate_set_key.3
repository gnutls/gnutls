.SH " DESCRIPTION"
This function sets a certificate/private key pair in the
gnutls_certificate_credentials_t structure.  This function may be
called more than once, in case multiple keys/certificates exist for
the server.  For clients that wants to send more than its own end
entity certificate (e.g., also an intermediate CA cert) then put
the certificate chain in \fIpcert_list\fP. The \fIpcert_list\fP and \fIkey\fP will
become part of the credentials structure and must not
be deallocated. They will be automatically deallocated when \fIres\fP is deinitialized.
.SH " RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) on success, or a negative error code.
.SH " SINCE"
3.0.0
