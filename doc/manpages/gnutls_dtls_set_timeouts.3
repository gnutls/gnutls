.SH NAME
gnutls_dtls_set_timeouts \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/dtls.h>
.sp
.BI "void gnutls_dtls_set_timeouts(gnutls_session_t " session ", unsigned int " retrans_timeout ", unsigned int " total_timeout ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.IP "unsigned int retrans_timeout" 12
The time at which a retransmission will occur in milliseconds
.IP "unsigned int total_timeout" 12
The time at which the connection will be aborted, in milliseconds.
.SH " DESCRIPTION"
This function will set the timeouts required for the DTLS handshake
protocol. The retransmission timeout is the time after which a
message from the peer is not received, the previous messages will
be retransmitted. The total timeout is the time after which the
handshake will be aborted with \fBGNUTLS_E_TIMEDOUT\fP.

The DTLS protocol recommends the values of 1 sec and 60 seconds
respectively.

If the retransmission timeout is zero then the handshake will operate
in a non\-blocking way, i.e., return \fBGNUTLS_E_AGAIN\fP.
