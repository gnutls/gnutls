@chapter Preface

@section Introduction

This document tries to demonstrate and explain the @acronym{GnuTLS}
library API.  A brief introduction to the protocols and the technology
involved, is also included so that an application programmer can
better understand the @acronym{GnuTLS} purpose and actual offerings.
Even if @acronym{GnuTLS} is a typical library software, it operates
over several security and cryptographic protocols, which require the
programmer to make careful and correct usage of them, otherwise he
risks to offer just a false sense of security. Security and the
network security terms are very general terms even for computer
software thus cannot be easily restricted to a single cryptographic
library.  For that reason, do not consider a program secure just
because it uses @acronym{GnuTLS}; there are several ways to compromise
a program or a communication line and @acronym{GnuTLS} only helps with
some of them.

This document tries to be self contained, although basic network
programming and PKI knowlegde is assumed in most of it.  Peter
Gutmann's ``Everything you never wanted to know about PKI but were
forced to find out''@footnote{Available from
@url{http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/pkitutorial.pdf}} is a
good introduction to Public Key Infrastructure.

@section Availability

Updated versions of the @acronym{GnuTLS} software and this document
will be available from @url{http://www.gnutls.org/} and
@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/}.

@node The Library
@chapter The Library

In brief @acronym{GnuTLS} can be described as a library which offers an API
to access secure communication protocols. These protocols provide
privacy over insecure lines, and were designed to prevent
eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery.

Technically @acronym{GnuTLS} is a portable ANSI C based library which
implements the TLS 1.0 (@xref{Introduction to TLS}, for a more
detailed description of the protocols) and SSL 3.0 protocols,
accompanied with the required framework for authentication and public
key infrastructure.  The library is available under the GNU Lesser GPL
license@footnote{A copy of the license is included in the
distribution}.  Important features of the @acronym{GnuTLS} library
include:

@itemize

@item Support for TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, and SSL 3.0 protocols.

@item Support for both @acronym{X.509} and @acronym{OpenPGP} certificates.

@item Support for handling and verification of certificates.

@item Support for @acronym{SRP} for TLS authentication.

@item Support for TLS Extension mechanism.

@item Support for TLS Compression Methods.

@end itemize

Additionally @acronym{GnuTLS} provides a limited emulation API for the
widely used OpenSSL@footnote{@url{http://www.openssl.org/}} library,
to ease integration with existing applications.

@acronym{GnuTLS} consists of three independent parts, namely the ``TLS
protocol part'', the ``Certificate part'', and the ``Crypto backend''
part.  The `TLS protocol part' is the actual protocol implementation,
and is entirely implemented within the @acronym{GnuTLS} library.  The
`Certificate part' consists of the certificate parsing, and
verification functions which is partially implemented in the
@acronym{GnuTLS} library.  The
@acronym{Libtasn1}@footnote{@url{ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/gnutls/libtasn1/}},
a library which offers @acronym{ASN.1} parsing capabilities, is used
for the @acronym{X.509} certificate parsing functions, and
@acronym{Opencdk}@footnote{@url{ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/gnutls/opencdk/}}
is used for the @acronym{OpenPGP} key support in @acronym{GnuTLS}.
The ``Crypto backend'' is provided by the
@acronym{Libgcrypt}@footnote{@url{ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/libgcrypt/}}
library.

In order to ease integration in embedded systems, parts of the
@acronym{GnuTLS} library can be disabled at compile time. That way a
small library, with the required features, can be generated.

@section General Idea

A brief description of how @acronym{GnuTLS} works internally is shown
at the figure below. This section may be easier to understand after
having seen the examples (@pxref{examples}).

@image{internals,12cm,8cm}

As shown in the figure, there is a read-only global state that is
initialized once by the global initialization function.  This global
structure, among others, contains the memory allocation functions
used, and some structures needed for the @acronym{ASN.1} parser.  This structure
is never modified by any @acronym{GnuTLS} function, except for the
deinitialization function which frees all memory allocated in the
global structure and is called after the program has permanently
finished using @acronym{GnuTLS}.

The credentials structure is used by some authentication methods, such
as certificate authentication (@pxref{Certificate Authentication}).  A
credentials structure may contain certificates, private keys,
temporary parameters for diffie hellman or RSA key exchange, and other
stuff that may be shared between several TLS sessions.

This structure should be initialized using the appropriate
initialization functions. For example an application which uses
certificate authentication would probably initialize the credentials,
using the appropriate functions, and put its trusted certificates in
this structure. The next step is to associate the credentials
structure with each @acronym{TLS} session.

A @acronym{GnuTLS} session contains all the required stuff for a
session to handle one secure connection. This session calls directly
to the transport layer functions, in order to communicate with the
peer.  Every session has a unique session ID shared with the peer.

Since TLS sessions can be resumed, servers would probably need a
database backend to hold the session's parameters.  Every
@acronym{GnuTLS} session after a successful handshake calls the
appropriate backend function (@xref{resume}, for information on
initialization) to store the newly negotiated session. The session
database is examined by the server just after having received the
client hello@footnote{The first message in a @acronym{TLS} handshake},
and if the session ID sent by the client, matches a stored session,
the stored session will be retrieved, and the new session will be a
resumed one, and will share the same session ID with the previous one.

@section Error handling

In @acronym{GnuTLS} most functions return an integer type as a result.  In
almost all cases a zero or a positive number means success, and a
negative number indicates failure, or a situation that some action has
to be taken. Thus negative error codes may be fatal or not.

Fatal errors terminate the connection immediately and further sends
and receives will be disallowed. An example of a fatal error code is
@code{GNUTLS_E_DECRYPTION_FAILED}. Non-fatal errors may warn about
something, ie a warning alert was received, or indicate the some
action has to be taken. This is the case with the error code
@code{GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE} returned by @code{gnutls_record_recv}.
This error code indicates that the server requests a re-handshake. The
client may ignore this request, or may reply with an alert.  You can
test if an error code is a fatal one by using the
@code{gnutls_error_is_fatal}.

If any non fatal errors, that require an action, are to be returned by
a function, these error codes will be documented in the function's
reference.  @xref{Error Codes}, for all the error codes.

@section Memory handling

@acronym{GnuTLS} internally handles heap allocated objects
differently, depending on the sensitivity of the data they
contain. However for performance reasons, the default memory functions
do not overwrite sensitive data from memory, nor protect such objects
from being written to the swap.  In order to change the default
behavior the @code{gnutls_global_set_mem_functions} function is
available which can be used to set other memory handlers than the
defaults.

The @acronym{Libgcrypt} library on which @acronym{GnuTLS} depends, has such
secure memory allocation functions available. These should be used in
cases where even the system's swap memory is not considered
secure. See the documentation of @acronym{Libgcrypt} for more
information.

@section Callback functions
@cindex Callback functions

There are several cases where @acronym{GnuTLS} may need some out of
band input from your program. This is now implemented using some
callback functions, which your program is expected to register.

An example of this type of functions are the push and pull callbacks
which are used to specify the functions that will retrieve and send
data to the transport layer.

@itemize

@item @code{gnutls_transport_set_push_function}

@item @code{gnutls_transport_set_pull_function}

@end itemize

Other callback functions such as the one set by
@code{gnutls_srp_set_server_credentials_function}, may require more
complicated input, including data to be allocated.  These callbacks
should allocate and free memory using the functions shown below.

@itemize

@item @code{gnutls_malloc}

@item @code{gnutls_free}

@end itemize

@node Introduction to TLS
@chapter Introduction to TLS

@acronym{TLS} stands for ``Transport Layer Security'' and is the
successor of SSL, the Secure Sockets Layer protocol@footnote{Described
in @cite{SSL3}} designed by Netscape.  @acronym{TLS} 1.0 is an
Internet protocol, defined by @acronym{IETF}@footnote{IETF, or
Internet Engineering Task Force, is a large open international
community of network designers, operators, vendors, and researchers
concerned with the evolution of the Internet architecture and the
smooth operation of the Internet.  It is open to any interested
individual.}, described in @acronym{RFC} 2246 and also in
@cite{RESCOLA}. The protocol provides confidentiality, and
authentication layers over any reliable transport layer. The
description, below, refers to @acronym{TLS} 1.0 but also applies to
@acronym{SSL} 3.0 since the differences of these protocols are
minor. Older protocols such as @acronym{SSL} 2.0 are not discussed nor
implemented in @acronym{GnuTLS} since they are not considered secure
today.

@section TLS layers
@cindex TLS Layers

@acronym{TLS} 1.0 is a layered protocol, and consists of the Record
Protocol, the Handshake Protocol and the Alert Protocol. The Record
Protocol is to serve all other protocols and is above the transport
layer.  The Record protocol offers symmetric encryption, data
authenticity, and optionally compression.

The Alert protocol offers some signaling to the other protocols. It
can help informing the peer for the cause of failures and other error
conditions.  @xref{The Alert Protocol}, for more information.  The
alert protocol is above the record protocol.

The Handshake protocol is responsible for the security parameters'
negotiation, the initial key exchange and authentication.  @xref{The
Handshake Protocol}, for more information about the handshake
protocol.  The protocol layering in TLS is shown in the figure below.

@image{layers,12cm,8cm}

@section The transport layer
@cindex Transport protocol

@acronym{TLS} is not limited to one transport layer, it can be used
above any transport layer, as long as it is a reliable one.  A set of
functions is provided and their purpose is to load to @acronym{GnuTLS} the
required callbacks to access the transport layer.

@itemize
@item @code{gnutls_transport_set_push_function}
@item @code{gnutls_transport_set_pull_function}
@item @code{gnutls_transport_set_ptr}
@end itemize

These functions accept a callback function as a parameter.  The
callback functions should return the number of bytes written, or -1 on
error and should set @code{errno} appropriately.

@acronym{GnuTLS} currently only interprets the EINTR and EAGAIN errno
values and returns the corresponding @acronym{GnuTLS} error codes
@code{GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED} and @code{GNUTLS_E_AGAIN}.  These values
are usually returned by interrupted system calls, or when non blocking
IO is used. All @acronym{GnuTLS} functions can be resumed (called
again), if any of these error codes is returned.  The error codes
above refer to the system call, not the @acronym{GnuTLS} function,
since signals do not interrupt @acronym{GnuTLS}' functions.

By default, if the transport functions are not set, @acronym{GnuTLS}
will use the Berkeley Sockets functions.  In this case
@acronym{GnuTLS} will use some hacks in order for @code{select} to
work, thus making it easy to add @acronym{TLS} support to existing
TCP/IP servers.

@section The TLS record protocol
@cindex Record protocol

The Record protocol is the secure communications provider. Its purpose
is to encrypt, authenticate and --optionally-- compress packets.
The following functions are available:

@itemize

@item @code{gnutls_record_send}
To send a record packet (with application data).

@item @code{gnutls_record_recv}:
To receive a record packet (with application data).
@end itemize

As you may have already noticed, the functions which access the Record
protocol, are quite limited, given the importance of this protocol in
@acronym{TLS}.  This is because the Record protocol's parameters are
all set by the Handshake protocol.

The Record protocol initially starts with NULL parameters, which means
no encryption, and no MAC is used. Encryption and authentication begin
just after the handshake protocol has finished.

@subsection Encryption algorithms used in the record layer
@cindex Symmetric encryption algorithms

Confidentiality in the record layer is achieved by using symmetric
block encryption algorithms like @code{3DES}, @code{AES}@footnote{AES,
or Advanced Encryption Standard, is actually the RIJNDAEL algorithm.
This is the algorithm that replaced DES.}, or stream algorithms like
@code{ARCFOUR_128}@footnote{@code{ARCFOUR_128} is a compatible
algorithm with RSA's RC4 algorithm, which is considered to be a trade
secret.}. Ciphers are encryption algorithms that use a single, secret,
key to encrypt and decrypt data. Block algorithms in TLS also provide
protection against statistical analysis of the data.  Thus, if you're
using the @acronym{TLS} 1.0 protocol, a random number of blocks will
be appended to data, to prevent eavesdroppers from guessing the actual
data size.

Supported cipher algorithms:

@itemize

@item @code{3DES_CBC}
@code{3DES_CBC} is the DES block cipher algorithm used with triple
encryption (EDE). Has 64 bits block size and is used in CBC mode.

@item @code{ARCFOUR_128}
ARCFOUR is a fast stream cipher.

@item @code{ARCFOUR_40}
This is the ARCFOUR cipher that is fed with a 40 bit key,
which is considered weak.

@item @code{AES_CBC}
AES or RIJNDAEL is the block cipher algorithm that replaces the old
DES algorithm.  Has 128 bits block size and is used in CBC mode. This
is not officially supported in TLS.

@end itemize

Supported MAC algorithms:

@itemize
@item @code{MAC_MD5}
MD5 is a cryptographic hash algorithm designed by Ron Rivest. Outputs
128 bits of data.

@item @code{MAC_SHA}
SHA is a cryptographic hash algorithm designed by NSA. Outputs 160
bits of data.

@item @code{MAC_RMD160}
RIPEMD is a cryptographic hash algorithm developed in the framework of
the EU project RIPE. Outputs 160 bits of data.

@end itemize

@subsection Compression algorithms used in the record layer
@cindex Compression algorithms

The TLS record layer also supports compression.  The algorithms
implemented in @acronym{GnuTLS} can be found in figure
@cite{compression}.  All the algorithms except for DEFLATE which is
referenced in @cite{TLSCOMP}, should be considered as
@acronym{GnuTLS}' extensions@footnote{You should use
@code{gnutls_handshake_set_private_extensions} to enable private
extensions.}, and should be advertised only when the peer is known to
have a compliant client, to avoid interoperability problems.

The included algorithms perform really good when text, or other
compressible data are to be transfered, but offer nothing on already
compressed data, such as compressed images, zipped archives etc.
These compression algorithms, may be useful in high bandwidth TLS
tunnels, and in cases where network usage has to be minimized. As a
drawback, compression increases latency.

The record layer compression in @acronym{GnuTLS} is implemented based
on the paper @cite{TLSCOMP}.

Supported compression algorithms:

@itemize
@item DEFLATE
Zlib compression, using the deflate algorithm.

@item LZO
LZO is a very fast compression algorithm. This algorithm is only
available if the @acronym{GnuTLS-extra} library has been initialized
and the private extensions are enabled.

@end itemize

@subsection Weaknesses and countermeasures

Some weaknesses that may affect the security of the Record layer have
been found in @acronym{TLS} 1.0 protocol. These weaknesses can be
exploited by active attackers, and exploit the facts that

@enumerate

@item
@acronym{TLS} has separate alerts for ``decryption_failed'' and
``bad_record_mac''

@item
The decryption failure reason can be detected by timing the response
time.

@item
The IV for CBC encrypted packets is the last block of the previous
encrypted packet.

@end enumerate

Those weaknesses were solved in @acronym{TLS} 1.1 which is implemented
in @acronym{GnuTLS}. For a detailed discussion see the archives of the
TLS Working Group mailing list and the paper @cite{CBCATT}.

@section The TLS Alert Protocol
@anchor{The Alert Protocol}
@cindex Alert protocol

The Alert protocol is there to allow signals to be sent between peers.
These signals are mostly used to inform the peer about the cause of a
protocol failure. Some of these signals are used internally by the
protocol and the application protocol does not have to cope with them
(see @code{GNUTLS_A_CLOSE_NOTIFY}), and others refer to the
application protocol solely (see @code{GNUTLS_A_USER_CANCELLED}).  An
alert signal includes a level indication which may be either fatal or
warning. Fatal alerts always terminate the current connection, and
prevent future renegotiations using the current session ID.

The alert messages are protected by the record protocol, thus the
information that is included does not leak. You must take extreme care
for the alert information not to leak to a possible attacker, via
public log files etc.

@itemize
@item @code{gnutls_alert_send}:
To send an alert signal.

@item @code{gnutls_error_to_alert}:
To map a gnutls error number to an alert signal.

@item @code{gnutls_alert_get}:
Returns the last received alert.

@item @code{gnutls_alert_get_name}:
Returns the name, in a character array, of the given alert.

@end itemize

@section The TLS Handshake Protocol
@anchor{The Handshake Protocol}
@cindex Handshake protocol

The Handshake protocol is responsible for the ciphersuite negotiation,
the initial key exchange, and the authentication of the two peers.
This is fully controlled by the application layer, thus your program
has to set up the required parameters. Available functions to control
the handshake protocol include:

@itemize
@item @code{gnutls_cipher_set_priority}:
To set the priority of bulk cipher algorithms.

@item @code{gnutls_mac_set_priority}:
To set the priority of MAC algorithms.

@item @code{gnutls_kx_set_priority}:
To set the priority of key exchange algorithms.

@item @code{gnutls_compression_set_priority}:
To set the priority of compression methods.

@item @code{gnutls_certificate_type_set_priority}:
To set the priority of certificate types (e.g., @acronym{OpenPGP},
@acronym{X.509}).

@item @code{gnutls_protocol_set_priority}:
To set the priority of protocol versions (e.g., @acronym{SSL} 3.0,
@acronym{TLS} 1.0).

@item @code{gnutls_set_default_priority}:
To set some defaults in the current session.  That way you don't have
to call each priority function, independently, but you have to live
with the defaults.

@item @code{gnutls_credentials_set}:
To set the appropriate credentials structures.

@item @code{gnutls_certificate_server_set_request}:
To set whether client certificate is required or not.

@item @code{gnutls_handshake}:
To initiate the handshake.
@end itemize

@subsection TLS cipher suites

The Handshake Protocol of @acronym{TLS} 1.0 negotiates cipher suites 
of the form @code{TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_CBC_SHA}.
The usual cipher suites contain these parameters:

@itemize

@item The key exchange algorithm.
@code{DHE_RSA} in the example.

@item The Symmetric encryption algorithm and mode
@code{3DES_CBC} in this example.

@item The MAC@footnote{MAC stands for Message Authentication Code. It can be described as a keyed hash algorithm. See RFC2104.} algorithm used for authentication.
@code{MAC_SHA} is used in the above example.

@end itemize

The cipher suite negotiated in the handshake protocol will affect the
Record Protocol, by enabling encryption and data authentication.  Note
that you should not over rely on @acronym{TLS} to negotiate the
strongest available cipher suite. Do not enable ciphers and algorithms
that you consider weak.

The priority functions, dicussed above, allow the application layer to
enable and set priorities on the individual ciphers. It may imply that
all combinations of ciphersuites are allowed, but this is not
true. For several reasons, not discussed here, some combinations were
not defined in the @acronym{TLS} protocol.  The supported ciphersuites
are shown in @ref{ciphersuites}.

@subsection Client authentication
@cindex Client Certificate authentication

In the case of ciphersuites that use certificate authentication, the
authentication of the client is optional in @acronym{TLS}.  A server
may request a certificate from the client -- using the
@code{gnutls_certificate_server_set_request} function. If a
certificate is to be requested from the client during the handshake,
the server will send a certificate request message that contains a
list of acceptable certificate signers. The client may then send a
certificate, signed by one of the server's acceptable signers. In
@acronym{GnuTLS} the server's acceptable signers list is constructed
using the trusted CA certificates in the credentials structure.

@subsection Resuming Sessions
@anchor{resume}
@cindex Resuming sessions

The @code{gnutls_handshake} function, is expensive since a lot of
calculations are performed. In order to support many fast connections
to the same server a client may use session resuming. @strong{Session
resuming} is a feature of the @acronym{TLS} protocol which allows a
client to connect to a server, after a successful handshake, without
the expensive calculations.  This is achieved by using the previously
established keys. @acronym{GnuTLS} supports this feature, and the
example (@pxref{ex:resume-client}) illustrates a typical use of it.

Keep in mind that sessions are expired after some time, for security
reasons, thus it may be normal for a server not to resume a session
even if you requested that.  Also note that you must enable, using the
priority functions, at least the algorithms used in the last session.

@subsection Resuming internals

The resuming capability, mostly in the server side, is one of the
problems of a thread-safe TLS implementations. The problem is that all
threads must share information in order to be able to resume
sessions. The gnutls approach is, in case of a client, to leave all
the burden of resuming to the client. Ie. copy and keep the necessary
parameters. See the functions:

@itemize

@item @code{gnutls_session_get_data}

@item @code{gnutls_session_get_id}

@item @code{gnutls_session_set_data}

@end itemize

The server side is different. A server has to specify some callback
functions which store, retrieve and delete session data. These can be
registered with:

@itemize

@item @code{gnutls_db_set_remove_function}

@item @code{gnutls_db_set_store_function}

@item @code{gnutls_db_set_retrieve_function}

@item @code{gnutls_db_set_ptr}

@end itemize

It might also be useful to be able to check for expired sessions in
order to remove them, and save space. The function
@code{gnutls_db_check_entry} is provided for that reason.

@section TLS Extensions
@cindex TLS Extensions

A number of extensions to the @acronym{TLS} protocol have been
proposed mainly in @acronym{RFC} 3546
(@url{http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3546.txt}). The extensions supported
in @acronym{GnuTLS} are

@itemize
@item Maximum fragment length negotiation
@item Server name indication
@end itemize

discussed in the subsections that follow.

@subsection Maximum fragment length negotiation
@cindex TLS Extensions
@cindex Maximum fragment length

This extension allows a @acronym{TLS} 1.0 implementation to negotiate
a smaller value for record packet maximum length. This extension may
be useful to clients with constrained capabilities. See the
@code{gnutls_record_set_max_size} and the
@code{gnutls_record_get_max_size} functions.

@subsection Server name indication
@anchor{serverind}
@cindex TLS Extensions
@cindex Server name indication

A common problem in @acronym{HTTPS} servers is the fact that the
@acronym{TLS} protocol is not aware of the hostname that a client
connects to, when the handshake procedure begins. For that reason the
@acronym{TLS} server has no way to know which certificate to send.

This extension solves that problem within the @acronym{TLS} protocol,
and allows a client to send the HTTP hostname before the handshake
begins within the first handshake packet.  The functions
@code{gnutls_server_name_set} and @code{gnutls_server_name_get} can be
used to enable this extension, or to retrieve the name sent by a
client.

@node Authentication methods
@chapter Authentication methods

The @acronym{TLS} protocol provides confidentiality and encryption,
but also offers authentication, which is a prerequisite for a secure
connection. The available authentication methods in @acronym{GnuTLS}
are:

@itemize

@item Certificate authentication

@item Anonymous authentication

@item @acronym{SRP} authentication

@end itemize

@section Certificate authentication

@subsection Authentication using @acronym{X.509} certificates
@cindex @acronym{X.509} certificates

@acronym{X.509} certificates contain the public parameters, of a
public key algorithm, and an authority's signature, which proves the
authenticity of the parameters.  @xref{The X.509 trust model}, for
more information on @acronym{X.509} protocols.

@subsection Authentication using @acronym{OpenPGP}keys
@cindex @acronym{OpenPGP} Keys

@acronym{OpenPGP} keys also contain public parameters of a public key
algorithm, and signatures from several other parties. Depending on
whether a signer is trusted the key is considered trusted or not.
@acronym{GnuTLS}'s @acronym{OpenPGP} authentication implementation is
based on the @cite{TLSPGP} proposal.

@xref{The OpenPGP trust model}, for more information about the
@acronym{OpenPGP} trust model.  For a more detailed introduction to
@acronym{OpenPGP} and @acronym{GnuPG} see Mike Ashley's @cite{The GNU
Privacy
Handbook}@footnote{@url{http://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html}}.

@subsection Using certificate authentication

In @acronym{GnuTLS} both the @acronym{OpenPGP} and @acronym{X.509}
certificates are part of the certificate authentication and thus are
handled using a common API.

When using certificates the server is required to have at least one
certificate and private key pair. A client may or may not have such a
pair. The certificate and key pair should be loaded, before any
@acronym{TLS} session is initialized, in a certificate credentials
structure. This should be done by using
@code{gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file} or
@code{gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_key_file} depending on the
certificate type.  In the @acronym{X.509} case, the functions will
also accept and use a certificate list that leads to a trusted
authority. The certificate list must be ordered in such way that every
certificate certifies the one before it. The trusted authority's
certificate need not to be included, since the peer should possess it
already.

As an alternative, a callback may be used so the server or the client
specify the certificate and the key at the handshake time.  That
callback can be set using the functions:

@itemize

@item @code{gnutls_certificate_server_set_retrieve_function}

@item @code{gnutls_certificate_client_set_retrieve_function}

@end itemize

Certificate verification is possible by loading the trusted
authorities into the credentials structure by using
@code{gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust_file} or
@code{gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_keyring_file} for openpgp
keys. Note however that the peer's certificate is not automatically
verified, you should call @code{gnutls_certificate_verify_peers},
after a successful handshake, to verify the signatures of the
certificate.  An alternative way, which reports a more detailed
verification output, is to use @code{gnutls_certificate_get_peers} to
obtain the raw certificate of the peer and verify it using the
functions discussed in @ref{The X.509 trust model}.

In a handshake, the negotiated cipher suite depends on the
certificate's parameters, so not all key exchange methods will be
available with some certificates. @acronym{GnuTLS} will disable
ciphersuites that are not compatible with the key, or the enabled
authentication methods.  For example keys marked as sign-only, will
not be able to access the plain RSA ciphersuites, but only the
@code{DHE_RSA} ones. It is recommended not to use RSA keys for both
signing and encryption. If possible use the same key for the
@code{DHE_RSA} and @code{RSA_EXPORT} ciphersuites, which use signing,
and a different key for the plain RSA ciphersuites, which use
encryption.  All the key exchange methods shown below are available in
certificate authentication.

Note that the DHE key exchange methods are generally
slower@footnote{It really depends on the group used.  Primes with
lesser bits are always faster, but also easier to break.  Values less
than 768 should not be used today} than plain RSA and require Diffie
Hellman parameters to be generated and associated with a credentials
structure.  The @code{RSA-EXPORT} method also requires 512 bit RSA
parameters, that should also be generated and associated with the
credentials structure.  See the functions:

@itemize

@item @code{gnutls_dh_params_generate2}

@item @code{gnutls_certificate_set_dh_params}

@item @code{gnutls_rsa_params_generate2}

@item @code{gnutls_certificate_set_rsa_export_params}

@end itemize

Key exchange algorithms for @acronym{OpenPGP} and @acronym{X.509}
certificates:

@itemize

@item @code{RSA}:
The RSA algorithm is used to encrypt a key and send it to the peer.
The certificate must allow the key to be used for encryption.

@item @code{RSA_EXPORT}:
The RSA algorithm is used to encrypt a key and send it to the peer.
In the EXPORT algorithm, the server signs temporary RSA parameters of
512 bits -- which are considered weak -- and sends them to the client.

@item @code{DHE_RSA}:
The RSA algorithm is used to sign Ephemeral Diffie Hellman parameters
which are sent to the peer. The key in the certificate must allow the
key to be used for signing. Note that key exchange algorithms which
use Ephemeral Diffie Hellman parameters, offer perfect forward
secrecy. That means that even if the private key used for signing is
compromised, it cannot be used to reveal past session data.

@item @code{DHE_DSS}:
The DSS algorithm is used to sign Ephemeral Diffie Hellman parameters
which are sent to the peer. The certificate must contain DSA
parameters to use this key exchange algorithm. DSS stands for Digital
Signature Standard.

@end itemize

@section Anonymous authentication
@cindex Anonymous authentication

The anonymous key exchange perform encryption but there is no
indication of the identity of the peer.  This kind of authentication
is vulnerable to a man in the middle attack, but this protocol can be
used even if there is no prior communication and trusted parties with
the peer, or when full anonymity is required.  Unless really required,
do not use anonymous authentication.  Available key exchange methods
are shown below.

Note that the key exchange methods for anonymous authentication
require Diffie Hellman parameters to be generated and associated with
an anonymous credentials structure.

Supported anonymous key exchange algorithms:

@itemize

@item @code{ANON_DH}:
This algorithm exchanges Diffie Hellman parameters.

@end itemize

@section Authentication using @acronym{SRP}
@cindex @acronym{SRP} authentication

Authentication using the @acronym{SRP}@footnote{@acronym{SRP} stands
for Secure Remote Password, and is described in @cite{RFC2945}}. The
@acronym{SRP} key exchange is an extension to the @acronym{TLS} 1.0
protocol protocol is actually password authentication. The two peers
can be identified using a single password, or there can be
combinations where the client is authenticated using @acronym{SRP} and
the server using a certificate.

The advantage of @acronym{SRP} authentication, over other proposed
secure password authentication schemas, is that @acronym{SRP} does not
require the server to hold the user's password.  This kind of
protection is similar to the one used traditionally in the @emph{UNIX}
@file{/etc/passwd} file, where the contents of this file did not cause
harm to the system security if they were revealed.  The @acronym{SRP}
needs instead of the plain password something called a verifier, which
is calculated using the user's password, and if stolen cannot be used
to impersonate the user. See @cite{TOMSRP} for a detailed description
of the @acronym{SRP} protocol and the Stanford @acronym{SRP}
libraries, which includes a PAM module that synchronizes the system's
users passwords with the @acronym{SRP} password files. That way
@acronym{SRP} authentication could be used for all the system's users.

The implementation in @acronym{GnuTLS} is based on paper
@cite{TLSSRP}.  The supported @acronym{SRP} key exchange methods are:

@itemize

@item @code{SRP}:
Authentication using the @acronym{SRP} protocol.

@item @code{SRP_DSS}:
Client authentication using the @acronym{SRP} protocol. Server is
authenticated using a certificate with DSA parameters.

@item @code{SRP_RSA}:
Client authentication using the @acronym{SRP} protocol. Server is
authenticated using a certificate with RSA parameters.

@end itemize

If clients supporting @acronym{SRP} know the username and password
before the connection, should initialize the client credentials and
call the function @code{gnutls_srp_set_client_credentials}.
Alternatively they could specify a callback function by using the
function @code{gnutls_srp_set_client_credentials_function}.  This has
the advantage that allows probing the server for @acronym{SRP}
support.  In that case the callback function will be called twice per
handshake.  The first time is before the ciphersuite is negotiated,
and if the callback returns a negative error code, the callback will
be called again if @acronym{SRP} has been negotiated.  This uses a
special @acronym{TLS}-@acronym{SRP} handshake idiom in order to avoid,
in interactive applications, to ask the user for @acronym{SRP}
password and username if the server does not negotiate an
@acronym{SRP} ciphersuite.

In server side the default behaviour of @acronym{GnuTLS} is to read
the usernames and @acronym{SRP} verifiers from password files. These
password files are the ones used by the @emph{Stanford srp libraries}
and can be specified using the
@code{gnutls_srp_set_server_credentials_file}.  If a different
password file format is to be used, then the function
@code{gnutls_srp_set_server_credentials_function}, should be called,
in order to set an appropriate callback.

Some helper functions such as:

@itemize

@item @code{gnutls_srp_verifier}

@item @code{gnutls_srp_base64_encode}

@item @code{gnutls_srp_base64_decode}

@end itemize

Are included in @acronym{GnuTLS}, and may be used to generate, and
maintain @acronym{SRP} verifiers, and password files.  A program to
manipulate the required parameters for @acronym{SRP} authentication is
also included.  @xref{srptool}, for more information.

@section Authentication and credentials

In @acronym{GnuTLS} every key exchange method is associated with a
credentials type. So in order to enable to enable a specific method,
the corresponding credentials type should be initialized and set using
@code{gnutls_credentials_set}.  A mapping is shown below.

@section Parameters stored in credentials

Several parameters such as the ones used for Diffie-Hellman
authentication are stored within the credentials structures, so all
sessions can access them. Those parameters are stored in structures
such as @code{gnutls_dh_params} and @code{gnutls_rsa_params}, and
functions like @code{gnutls_certificate_set_dh_params} and
@code{gnutls_certificate_set_rsa_export_params} can be used to
associate those parameters with the given credentials structure.

Since those parameters need to be renewed from time to time and a
global structure such as the credentials, may not be easy to modify
since it is accessible by all sessions, an alternative interface is
available using a callback function.  This can be set using the
@code{gnutls_certificate_set_params_function}.  An example is shown
below.

@example
#include <gnutls.h>

gnutls_rsa_params rsa_params;
gnutls_dh_params dh_params;

/* This function will be called once a session requests DH
 * or RSA parameters. The parameters returned (if any) will
 * be used for the first handshake only.
 */
static int get_params( gnutls_session session,
        gnutls_params_type_t type,
        gnutls_params_st *st)
@{
   if (type == GNUTLS_PARAMS_RSA_EXPORT)
      st->params.rsa_export = rsa_params;
   else if (type == GNUTLS_PARAMS_DH)
      st->params.dh = dh_params;
   else return -1;

   st->type = type;
   /* do not deinitialize those parameters.
    */
   st->deinit = 0;

   return 0;
@}

int main()
@{
   gnutls_certificate_credentials_t cert_cred;

   initialize_params();

   /* ...

@section The @acronym{X.509} trust model
@anchor{The X.509 trust model}
@cindex @acronym{X.509} certificates

The @acronym{X.509} protocols rely on a hierarchical trust model. In
this trust model Certification Authorities (CAs) are used to certify
entities.  Usually more than one certification authorities exist, and
certification authorities may certify other authorities to issue
certificates as well, following a hierarchical model.

@image{x509-1,7cm,9.5cm}

One needs to trust one or more CAs for his secure communications. In
that case only the certificates issued by the trusted authorities are
acceptable.  See the figure above for a typical example.  The API for
handling @acronym{X.509} certificates is described at section
@ref{sec:x509api}.  Some examples are listed below.

@subsection @acronym{X.509} certificates

An @acronym{X.509} certificate usually contains information about the
certificate holder, the signer, a unique serial number, expiration
dates and some other fields @cite{RFC3280} as shown in the table
below.

@itemize

@item @code{version}:
The field that indicates the version of the certificate.

@item @code{serialNumber}:
This field holds a unique serial number per certificate.

@item @code{issuer}:
Holds the issuer's distinguished name.

@item @code{validity}:
The activation and expiration dates.

@item @code{subject}:
The subject's distinguished name of the certificate.

@item @code{extensions}:
The extensions are fields only present in version 3 certificates.

@end itemize

The certificate's @emph{subject or issuer name} is not just a single
string.  It is a Distinguished name and in the @acronym{ASN.1}
notation is a sequence of several object IDs with their corresponding
values. Some of available OIDs to be used in an @acronym{X.509}
distinguished name are defined in @file{gnutls/x509.h}.

The @emph{Version} field in a certificate has values either 1 or 3 for
version 3 certificates.  Version 1 certificates do not support the
extensions field so it is not possible to distinguish a CA from a
person, thus their usage should be avoided.

The @emph{validity} dates are there to indicate the date that the
specific certificate was activated and the date the certificate's key
would be considered invalid.

Certificate @emph{extensions} are there to include information about
the certificate's subject that did not fit in the typical certificate
fields. Those may be e-mail addresses, flags that indicate whether the
belongs to a CA etc.  All the supported @acronym{X.509} version 3
extensions are shown in the table below.

@itemize

@item @code{subject key id} (2.5.29.14):
An identifier of the key of the subject.

@item @code{authority key id} (2.5.29.35):
An identifier of the authority's key used to sign the certificate.

@item @code{subject alternative name} (2.5.29.17):
Alternative names to subject's distinguished name.

@item @code{key usage} (2.5.29.15):
Constraints the key's usage of the certificate.

@item @code{extended key usage} (2.5.29.37):
Constraints the purpose of the certificate.

@item @code{basic constraints} (2.5.29.19):
Indicates whether this is a CA certificate or not.

@item @code{CRL distribution points} (2.5.29.31):
This extension is set by the CA, in order to inform about the issued CRLs.

@end itemize

In @acronym{GnuTLS} the @acronym{X.509} certificate structures are handled using
the @code{gnutls_x509_crt_t} type and the corresponding private keys
with the @code{gnutls_x509_privkey_t} type.  All the available
functions for @acronym{X.509} certificate handling have their prototypes in
@file{gnutls/x509.h}. An example program to demonstrate the @acronym{X.509}
parsing capabilities can be found at section @ref{ex:x509-info}.

@subsection Verifying @acronym{X.509} certificate paths
@cindex Verifying certificate paths

Verifying certificate paths is important in @acronym{X.509} authentication. For
this purpose the function @code{gnutls_x509_crt_verify} is
provided. The output of this function is the bitwise OR of the
elements of the @code{gnutls_certificate_status} enumeration.  A
detailed description of these elements can be found in figure below.
The function @code{gnutls_certificate_verify_peers} is equivalent to
the previous one, and will verify the peer's certificate in a TLS
session.

@itemize

@item @code{CERT_INVALID}:
The certificate is not signed by one of the known authorities, or
the signature is invalid.

@item @code{CERT_REVOKED}:
The certificate has been revoked.

@item @code{CERT_SIGNER_NOT_FOUND}:
The certificate's issuer is not known.

@end itemize

Although the verification of a certificate path indicates that the
certificate is signed by trusted authority, does not reveal anything
about the peer's identity. It is required to verify if the
certificate's owner is the one you expect. See @cite{RFC2818} and
section @ref{ex:verify} for an example.

@subsection @acronym{PKCS} #10 certificate requests
@cindex Certificate requests
@cindex @acronym{PKCS} #10

A certificate request is a structure, which contain information about
an applicant of a certificate service.  It usually contains a private
key, a distinguished name and secondary data such as a challenge
password. @acronym{GnuTLS} supports the requests defined in
@acronym{PKCS} #10 @cite{RFC2986}. Other certificate request's format
such as PKIX's @cite{RFC2511} are not currently supported.

In @acronym{GnuTLS} the @acronym{PKCS} #10 structures are handled
using the @code{gnutls_x509_crq_t} type.  An example of a certificate
request generation can be found at section @ref{ex:crq}.

@subsection @acronym{PKCS} #12 structures
@cindex @acronym{PKCS} #12

A @acronym{PKCS} #12 structure @cite{PKCS12} usually contains a user's
private keys and certificates. It is commonly used in browsers to
export and import the user's identities.

In @acronym{GnuTLS} the @acronym{PKCS} #12 structures are handled
using the @code{gnutls_pkcs12_t} type. This is an abstract type that
may hold several @code{gnutls_pkcs12_bag_t} types.  The Bag types are
the holders of the actual data, which may be certificates, private
keys or encrypted data.  An Bag of type encrypted should be decrypted
in order for its data to be accessed.

An example of a @acronym{PKCS} #12 structure generation can be found
at section @ref{ex:pkcs12}.

@section The @acronym{OpenPGP} trust model
@anchor{The OpenPGP trust model}
@cindex @acronym{OpenPGP} Keys

The @acronym{OpenPGP} key authentication relies on a distributed trust
model, called the ``web of trust''. The ``web of trust'' uses a
decentralized system of trusted introducers, which are the same as a
CA. @acronym{OpenPGP} allows anyone to sign anyone's else public
key. When Alice signs Bob's key, she is introducing Bob's key to
anyone who trusts Alice. If someone trusts Alice to introduce keys,
then Alice is a trusted introducer in the mind of that observer.

@image{pgp1,11cm,9cm}

For example: If David trusts Alice to be an introducer, and Alice
signed Bob's key, Dave also trusts Bob's key to be the real one.

There are some key points that are important in that model. In the
example Alice has to sign Bob's key, only if she is sure that the key
belongs to Bob. Otherwise she may also make Dave falsely believe that
this is Bob's key. Dave has also the responsibility to know who to
trust.  This model is similar to real life relations.

Just see how Charlie behaves in the previous example. Although he has
signed Bob's key - because he knows, somehow, that it belongs to Bob -
he does not trust Bob to be an introducer. Charlie decided to trust
only Kevin, for some reason. A reason could be that Bob is lazy
enough, and signs other people's keys without being sure that they
belong to the actual owner.

@subsection @acronym{OpenPGP} keys

In @acronym{GnuTLS} the @acronym{OpenPGP} key structures
@cite{RFC2440} are handled using the @code{gnutls_openpgp_key_t} type
and the corresponding private keys with the
@code{gnutls_openpgp_privkey_t} type. All the prototypes for the key
handling functions can be found at @file{gnutls/openpgp.h}.

@subsection Verifying an @acronym{OpenPGP} key

The verification functions of @acronym{OpenPGP} keys, included in
@acronym{GnuTLS}, are simple ones, and do not use the features of the
``web of trust''.  For that reason, if the verification needs are
complex, the assistance of external tools like @acronym{GnuPG} and
GPGME (@url{http://www.gnupg.org/related_software/gpgme/}) is
recommended.

There are two verification functions in @acronym{GnuTLS}, The
@code{gnutls_openpgp_key_verify_ring} and the
@code{gnutls_openpgp_key_verify_trustdb}.  The first one checks an
@acronym{OpenPGP} key against a given set of public keys (keyring) and
returns the key status. The key verification status is the same as in
@acronym{X.509} certificates, although the meaning and interpretation are
different. For example an @acronym{OpenPGP} key may be valid, if the
self signature is ok, even if no signers were found.  The meaning of
verification status is shown in the figure below.  The latter function
checks a @acronym{GnuPG} trust database for the given key. This
function does not check the key signatures, only checks for disabled
and revoked keys.

@itemize

@item @code{CERT_INVALID}:
A signature on the key is invalid. That means that the key was
modified by somebody, or corrupted during transport.

@item @code{CERT_REVOKED}:
The key has been revoked by its owner.

@item @code{CERT_SIGNER_NOT_FOUND}:
The key was not signed by a known signer.

@end itemize

@node How to use TLS in application protocols
@chapter How to use TLS in application protocols

@section Introduction

This chapter is intended to provide some hints on how to use the
@acronym{TLS} over simple custom made application protocols.  The discussion
below mainly refers to the @emph{TCP/IP} transport layer but may be
extended to other ones too.

@section Separate ports

Traditionally @acronym{SSL} was used in application protocols by
assigning a new port number for the secure services. That way two
separate ports were assigned, one for the non secure sessions, and one
for the secured ones. This has the benefit that if a user requests a
secure session then the client will try to connect to the secure port
and fail otherwise. The only possible attack with this method is a
denial of service one. The most famous example of this method is the
famous ``HTTP over TLS'' or @acronym{HTTPS} protocol @cite{RFC2818}.

Despite its wide use, this method is not as good as it seems.  This
approach starts the @acronym{TLS} Handshake procedure just after the
client connects on the --so called-- secure port.  That way the
@acronym{TLS} protocol does not know anything about the client, and
popular methods like the host advertising in HTTP do not
work@footnote{See also the Server Name Indication extension on
@ref{serverind}.}.  There is no way for the client to say ``I
connected to YYY server'' before the Handshake starts, so the server
cannot possibly know which certificate to use.

Other than that it requires two separate ports to run a single
service, which is unnecessary complication. Due to the fact that there
is a limitation on the available privileged ports, this approach was
soon obsoleted.

@section Upward negotiation

Other application protocols@footnote{See LDAP, IMAP etc.}  use a
different approach to enable the secure layer.  They use something
called the ``TLS upgrade'' method. This method is quite tricky but it
is more flexible. The idea is to extend the application protocol to
have a ``STARTTLS'' request, whose purpose it to start the TLS
protocols just after the client requests it.  This is a really neat
idea and does not require an extra port.

This method is used by almost all modern protocols and there is even
the @cite{RFC2817} paper which proposes extensions to HTTP to support
it.

The tricky part, in this method, is that the ``STARTTLS'' request is
sent in the clear, thus is vulnerable to modifications.  A typical
attack is to modify the messages in a way that the client is fooled
and thinks that the server does not have the ``STARTTLS'' capability.
See a typical conversation of a hypothetical protocol:

@quotation
(client connects to the server)

CLIENT: HELLO I'M MR. XXX

SERVER: NICE TO MEET YOU XXX

CLIENT: PLEASE START TLS

SERVER: OK

*** TLS STARTS

CLIENT: HERE ARE SOME CONFIDENTIAL DATA
@end quotation

And see an example of a conversation where someone is acting
in between:

@quotation
(client connects to the server)

CLIENT: HELLO I'M MR. XXX

SERVER: NICE TO MEET YOU XXX

CLIENT: PLEASE START TLS

(here someone inserts this message)

SERVER: SORRY I DON'T HAVE THIS CAPABILITY

CLIENT: HERE ARE SOME CONFIDENTIAL DATA
@end quotation

As you can see above the client was fooled, and was dummy enough to
send the confidential data in the clear.

How to avoid the above attack? As you may have already thought this
one is easy to avoid. The client has to ask the user before it
connects whether the user requests @acronym{TLS} or not. If the user
answered that he certainly wants the secure layer the last
conversation should be:

@quotation
(client connects to the server)

CLIENT: HELLO I'M MR. XXX

SERVER: NICE TO MEET YOU XXX

CLIENT: PLEASE START TLS

(here someone inserts this message)

SERVER: SORRY I DON'T HAVE THIS CAPABILITY

CLIENT: BYE

(the client notifies the user that the secure connection was not possible)
@end quotation

This method, if implemented properly, is far better than the
traditional method, and the security properties remain the same, since
only denial of service is possible. The benefit is that the server may
request additional data before the @acronym{TLS} Handshake protocol
starts, in order to send the correct certificate, use the correct
password file@footnote{in @acronym{SRP} authentication}, or anything
else!

@chapter How to use @acronym{GnuTLS} in applications
@anchor{examples}
@cindex Example programs

@section Preparation

To use @acronym{GnuTLS}, you have to perform some changes to your
sources and your build system. The necessary changes are explained in
the following subsections.

@subsection Headers

All the data types and functions of the @acronym{GnuTLS} library are
defined in the header file @file{gnutls/gnutls.h}.  This must be
included in all programs that make use of the @acronym{GnuTLS}
library.

The extra functionality of the @acronym{GnuTLS-extra} library is
available by including the header file @file{gnutls/extra.h} in your
programs.

@subsection Version check

It is often desirable to check that the version of `gnutls' used is
indeed one which fits all requirements.  Even with binary
compatibility new features may have been introduced but due to problem
with the dynamic linker an old version is actually used.  So you may
want to check that the version is okay right after program startup.
See the function @code{gnutls_check_version}.

@subsection Building the source

If you want to compile a source file including the `gnutls/gnutls.h'
header file, you must make sure that the compiler can find it in the
directory hierarchy.  This is accomplished by adding the path to the
directory in which the header file is located to the compilers include
file search path (via the -I option).

However, the path to the include file is determined at the time the
source is configured.  To solve this problem, @acronym{GnuTLS} ships
with two small helper programs @command{libgnutls-config} and
@command{libgnutls-extra-config} that knows about the path to the
include file and other configuration options.  The options that need
to be added to the compiler invocation at compile time are output by
the @code{--cflags} option to @command{libgnutls-config}.  The
following example shows how it can be used at the command line:

@example
gcc -c foo.c `libgnutls-config --cflags`
@end example

Adding the output of @command{libgnutls-config --cflags} to the
compilers command line will ensure that the compiler can find the
@acronym{GnuTLS} header file.

A similar problem occurs when linking the program with the library.
Again, the compiler has to find the library files.  For this to work,
the path to the library files has to be added to the library search
path (via the -L option).  For this, the option @code{--libs} to
@command{libgnutls-config} can be used.  For convenience, this option
also outputs all other options that are required to link the program
with the @acronym{GnuTLS} libararies.  The example shows how to link
`foo.o' with the @acronym{GnuTLS} libraries to a program @emph{foo}.

@example
gcc -o foo foo.o `libgnutls-config --libs`
@end example

Of course you can also combine both examples to a single command by
specifying both options to `libgnutls-config':

@example
gcc -o foo foo.c `libgnutls-config --cflags --libs`
@end example

@section Multi-threaded applications

Although the @acronym{GnuTLS} library is thread safe by design, some
parts of the crypto backend, such as the random generator, are
not. Since @emph{libgcrypt 1.1.92} there was an automatic detection of
the thread library used by the application, so most applications
wouldn't need to do any changes to ensure thread-safety. Due to the
unportability of the automatic thread detection, this was removed from
later releases of @emph{libgcrypt}, so applications have now to
register callback functions to ensure proper locking in sensitive

@section Client examples

This section contains examples of @acronym{TLS} and @acronym{SSL}
clients, using @acronym{GnuTLS}.  Note that these examples contain
little or no error checking.

@subsection Simple client example with anonymous authentication

The simplest client using TLS is the one that doesn't do any
authentication.  This means no external certificates or passwords are
needed to set up the connection.  As could be expected, the connection
is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (active or redirection) attacks.
However, the data is integrity and privacy protected.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-client1.c

@subsection Simple client example with @acronym{X.509} certificate support

Let's assume now that we want to create a TCP client which
communicates with servers that use @acronym{X.509} or
@acronym{OpenPGP} certificate authentication. The following client is
a very simple @acronym{TLS} client, it does not support session
resuming, not even certificate verification. The TCP functions defined
in this example are used in most of the other examples below, without
redefining them.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-client2.c

@subsection Obtaining session information

Most of the times it is desirable to know the security properties of
the current established session.  This includes the underlying ciphers
and the protocols involved.  That is the purpose of the following
function.  Note that this function will print meaningful values only
if called after a successful @code{gnutls_handshake}.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-session-info.c

@subsection Verifying peer's certificate
@anchor{ex:verify}

A @acronym{TLS} session is not secure just after the handshake
procedure has finished.  It must be considered secure, only after the
peer's certificate and identity have been verified. That is, you have
to verify the signature in peer's certificate, the hostname in the
certificate, and expiration dates.  Just after this step you should
treat the connection as being a secure one.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-rfc2818.c

An other example is listed below which provides a more detailed
verification output.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-verify.c

@subsection Using a callback to select the certificate to use

There are cases where a client holds several certificate and key
pairs, and may not want to load all of them in the credentials
structure.  The following example demonstrates the use of the
certificate selection callback.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-cert-select.c

@subsection Client with Resume capability example
@anchor{ex:resume-client}

This is a modification of the simple client example. Here we
demonstrate the use of session resumption. The client tries to connect
once using @acronym{TLS}, close the connection and then try to
establish a new connection using the previously negotiated data.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-client-resume.c

@subsection Simple client example with @acronym{SRP} authentication

The following client is a very simple @acronym{SRP} @acronym{TLS}
client which connects to a server and authenticates using a
@emph{username} and a @emph{password}. The server may authenticate
itself using a certificate, and in that case it has to be verified.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-client-srp.c

@section Server examples

This section contains examples of @acronym{TLS} and @acronym{SSL}
servers, using @acronym{GnuTLS}.

@subsection Echo Server with @acronym{X.509} authentication

This example is a very simple echo server which supports
@acronym{X.509} authentication, using the RSA ciphersuites.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-serv1.c

@subsection Echo Server with @acronym{X.509} authentication II

The following example is a server which supports @acronym{X.509}
authentication.  This server supports the export-grade cipher suites,
the DHE ciphersuites and session resuming.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-serv-export.c

@subsection Echo Server with @acronym{OpenPGP}authentication
@cindex @acronym{OpenPGP} Server

The following example is an echo server which supports
@acronym{@acronym{OpenPGP}} key authentication. You can easily combine
this functionality --that is have a server that supports both
@acronym{X.509} and @acronym{OpenPGP} certificates-- but we separated
them to keep these examples as simple as possible.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-serv-pgp.c

@subsection Echo Server with @acronym{SRP} authentication

This is a server which supports @acronym{SRP} authentication. It is
also possible to combine this functionality with a certificate
server. Here it is separate for simplicity.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-serv-srp.c

@subsection Echo Server with anonymous authentication

This example server support anonymous authentication, and could be
used to serve the example client for anonymous authentication.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-serv-anon.c

@section Miscellaneous examples

@subsection Checking for an alert

This is a function that checks if an alert has been received in the
current session.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-alert.c

@subsection @acronym{X.509} certificate parsing example
@anchor{ex:x509-info}

To demonstrate the @acronym{X.509} parsing capabilities an example program is
listed below.  That program reads the peer's certificate, and prints
information about it.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-x509-info.c

@subsection Certificate request generation
@anchor{ex:crq}

The following example is about generating a certificate request, and a
private key. A certificate request can be later be processed by a CA,
which should return a signed certificate.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-crq.c

@subsection @acronym{PKCS} #12 structure generation
@anchor{ex:pkcs12}

The following example is about generating a @acronym{PKCS} #12
structure.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-pkcs12.c

@section Compatibility with the OpenSSL library
@cindex OpenSSL

To ease @acronym{GnuTLS}' integration with existing applications, a
compatibility layer with the widely used OpenSSL library is included
in the @code{gnutls-openssl} library. This compatibility layer is not
complete and it is not intended to completely reimplement the OpenSSL
API with @acronym{GnuTLS}.  It only provides source-level
compatibility. There is currently no attempt to make it
binary-compatible with OpenSSL.

The prototypes for the compatibility functions are in the
@file{gnutls/openssl.h} header file.

Current limitations imposed by the compatibility layer include:

@section Invoking srptool
@anchor{Invoking srptool}
@anchor{srptool}
@cindex srptool

The @file{srptool} is a very simple program that emulates the programs
in the @emph{Stanford SRP libraries}.  It is intended for use in
places where you don't expect @acronym{SRP} authentication to be the
used for system users.  Traditionally @emph{libsrp} used two
files. One called 'tpasswd' which holds usernames and verifiers, and
'tpasswd.conf' which holds generators and primes.

How to use srptool:

@itemize

@item
To create tpasswd.conf which holds the g and n values for
@acronym{SRP} protocol (generator and a large prime), run:

@example
$ srptool --create-conf /etc/tpasswd.conf
@end example

@item
This command will create /etc/tpasswd and will add user 'test' (you
will also be prompted for a password). Verifiers are stored by default
in the way libsrp expects.

@example
$ srptool --passwd /etc/tpasswd \
    --passwd-conf /etc/tpasswd.conf -u test
@end example

@item
This command will check against a password. If the password matches
the one in /etc/tpasswd you will get an ok.

@example
$ srptool --passwd /etc/tpasswd \
    --passwd-conf /etc/tpasswd.conf --verify -u test
@end example

@section Invoking certtool
@anchor{Invoking certtool}
@cindex certtool

This is a program to generate @acronym{X.509} certificates, certificate
requests, CRLs and private keys. The program can be used interactively
or non interactively by specifying the @code{--template} command line
option. See @file{doc/certtool.cfg}, in the distribution, for an
example of a template file.

How to use certtool interactively:

@itemize

@item
To create a self signed certificate, use the command:
@example
$ certtool --generate-privkey --outfile ca-key.pem
$ certtool --generate-self-signed --load-privkey ca-key.pem \
   --outfile ca-cert.pem
@end example

Note that a self-signed certificate usually belongs to a certificate
authority, that signs other certificates.

@item
To create a private key, run:

@example
$ certtool --generate-privkey --outfile key.pem
@end example

@item
To create a certificate request, run:

@example
$ certtool --generate-request --load-privkey key.pem \
  --outfile request.pem
@end example

@item
To generate a certificate using the previous request, use the command:

@example
$ certtool --generate-certificate --load-request request.pem \
   --outfile cert.pem \
   --load-ca-certificate ca-cert.pem --load-ca-privkey ca-key.pem
@end example

@item
To view the certificate information, use:

@example
$ certtool --certificate-info --infile cert.pem
@end example

@item
To generate a @acronym{PKCS} #12 structure using the previous key and
certificate, use the command:

@example
$ certtool --load-certificate cert.pem --load-privkey key.pem \
  --to-p12 --outder --outfile key.p12
@end example

@end itemize

Certtool's template file format:

@itemize

@item
Firstly create a file named 'cert.cfg' that contains the information
about the certificate. An example file is listed below.

@item
Then execute:

@example
$ certtool --generate-certificate cert.pem --load-privkey key.pem  \
   --template cert.cfg \
   --load-ca-certificate ca-cert.pem --load-ca-privkey ca-key.pem
@end example

@end itemize
