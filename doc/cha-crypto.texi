@chapter Using GnuTLS as a cryptographic library

@acronym{GnuTLS} is not a low-level cryptographic library, i.e., 
it does not provide access to basic cryptographic primitives. However
it abstracts the internal cryptographic back-end (see @ref{Cryptographic Backend}),
providing symmetric crypto, hash and HMAC algorithms, as well access
to the random number generation.

@node Encryption algorithms
@section Encryption algorithms
@cindex encryption algorithms
@cindex symmetric cryptography

The available functions to access symmetric crypto algorithms operations
are shown below. The supported algorithms are the algorithms required by the TLS protocol.
They are listed in @ref{tab:ciphers}.

@showfuncE{gnutls_cipher_init,gnutls_cipher_encrypt2,gnutls_cipher_decrypt2,gnutls_cipher_set_iv,gnutls_cipher_deinit}

In order to support authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) algorithms the following
functions are provided to set the associated data and retrieve the authentication tag.

@node Hash and HMAC functions
@section Hash and HMAC functions
@cindex hash functions
@cindex HMAC functions

The available operations to access hash functions and hash-MAC (HMAC) algorithms
are shown below. HMAC algorithms provided keyed hash functionality. They supported HMAC algorithms are listed in @ref{tab:macs}.

@showfuncF{gnutls_hmac_init,gnutls_hmac,gnutls_hmac_output,gnutls_hmac_deinit,gnutls_hmac_get_len,gnutls_hmac_fast}

The available functions to access hash functions are shown below. The supported hash functions
are the same as the HMAC algorithms.

@node Random number generation
@section Random number generation
@cindex random numbers

Access to the random number generator is provided using the @funcref{gnutls_rnd}
function. It allows obtaining random data of various levels.
