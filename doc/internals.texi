This chapter is to give a brief description of the
way @acronym{GnuTLS} works. The focus is to give an idea
to potential developers and those who want to know what
happens inside the black box.

@section The TLS Protocol
The main needs for the TLS protocol to be used are
shown in the image below.

This is being accomplished by the following object diagram.
Note that since @acronym{GnuTLS} is being developed in C
object are just structures with attributes. The operations listed
are functions that require the first parameter to be that object.

@section TLS Handshake Protocol
The @acronym{GnuTLS} handshake protocol is implemented as a state
machine that waits for input or returns immediately when the non-blocking
transport layer functions are used. The main idea is shown in the following
figure.

@image{arch/handshake-state,9cm}

Also the way the input is processed varies per ciphersuite. Several 
implementations of the internal handlers are available and 
@ref{gnutls_handshake} only multiplexes the input to the appropriate 
handler. For example a @acronym{PSK} ciphersuite has a different 
implementation of the @code{process_client_key_exchange} than a
certificate ciphersuite.

@section TLS Authentication Methods
In @acronym{GnuTLS} authentication methods can be implemented quite easily.
Since the required changes to add a new authentication method affect only the
handshake protocol, a simple interface is used. An authentication method needs
only to implement the functions as seen in the figure below.

@image{arch/mod_auth_st,12cm}

The functions that need to be implemented are the ones responsible for interpreting
the handshake protocol messages. It is common for such functions to read data from
one or more @code{credentials_t} structures@footnote{such as the @code{gnutls_certificate_credentials_t} structures} and write data, such as certificates, usernames etc. to @code{auth_info_t} structures.

Simple examples of existing authentication methods can be seen in @code{auth_psk.c}
for PSK ciphersuites and @code{auth_srp.c} for SRP ciphersuites. After implementing these functions
the structure holding its pointers has to be registered in @code{gnutls_algorithms.c}
in the @code{_gnutls_kx_algorithms} structure.

@section TLS Extension Handling
As with authentication methods, the TLS extensions handlers can be implemented
using the following interface.

@image{arch/extensions_st,12cm}

Here there are two functions, one for receiving the extension data
and one for sending. These functions have to check internally whether
they operate in client or server side. 

A simple example of an extension handler can be seen in @code{ext_srp.c}
After implementing these functions, together with the extension number they
handle, they have to be registered in @code{gnutls_extensions.c} in the 
@code{_gnutls_extensions} structure.


@section Certificate Handling
What is provided by the certificate handling functions
is summarized in the following diagram.
